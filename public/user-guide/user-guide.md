### How It Works:
The marker starts at the map’s center and is moved using the arrow keys, allowing easy exploration.

**Audio Feedback** makes navigation accessible:
- You’ll hear guiding sounds as you move the marker.
- When crossing borders, you’ll hear an alert and receive border details.
- When the marker stops, it announces the current location.

This interactive feature is fun and engaging while helping users learn about world geography!

### Handy Map Shortcuts:
- Press `Z`: Learn the scale of distance traveled by the marker with each key press (varies by zoom level and latitude).
- Shift + Arrow Key: Find out how far the border is from the current marker position.
- Press `F`: Hear the marker’s current location.
- Shift + `F`: Get the exact coordinates of the marker.
- Press `Enter`: Select the marker’s location, highlighting it and showing more details on the left.

*Note: Ensure the map is in focus when using these shortcuts. If you’re using another feature, press `Tab` to refocus.*

## Adjustable Pointer (Adpointer)
The **Adpointer** adds an innovative twist to exploring and comparing distances on the map. It’s a great way to visualize locations interactively!

### How It Works:
1. Focus on the map and press `A` to activate the Adpointer.
2. An arrow will appear from the marker’s last location. You can move the arrowhead by adjusting its angle and length.
   - Angle starts at 0 degrees (north) and rotates clockwise. For example, 90 degrees points west.

A box in the lower left shows key details:
- The place the arrowhead points to.
- The distance of the arrow.
- The direction, flat map distance*, and coordinates of the arrowhead location.

- Press `S` to decrease the selected value.
- Press the arrow keys to turn off the Adpointer and resume marker navigation.
- Press `Enter` to place the marker at the arrowhead’s position and turn off the Adpointer.
- Press `O` to hear the info box details (distance, direction, and coordinates).

### How to Use:
- Click the button to find the distance, and input your starting location and destination.
- Select places from the map using the **Choose from Map** button.

## Inbound Navigation
**Inbound Navigation** adds a playful, interactive layer to map exploration!

### How It Works:
- When you search for a place and press `Enter`, two things happen:
  - The place is highlighted in the center of the map.
  - The marker moves to the center of that place.
- If the marker is within the boundary, it becomes trapped, and you can’t move it outside the border. This helps visualize borders in an engaging and interactive way!
